            from my father Assibi Abudu, the oldest son alive is that my
            grandmother Aishatu originally from what is now called Togo made her
            way to Kumasi and stayed there with some of her Bassari people. She
            met our grandfather there and became his first wife. He was at that
            time a police officer of the British Colony of the Gold Coast.

            before he met his other wives who also bore children with our
            grandfather."
